    "The subsettools package comes with a collection of template ParFlow runscripts which you can use as a starting point in constructing a ParFlow model. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a complete workflow subsetting and running ParFlow simulations refer to the [example_notebooks](https://hydroframesubsettools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_notebooks/example_notebooks.html) section.  Here we walk through more details on how to customize a run for your needs. Also note that if none of the template run scripts suite your needs there is a wide variety of test scripts and examples available through the ParFlow Repo and ParFlow short courses. For a complete list of ParFlow Resources checkout the [HydroFrame website](https://hydroframe.org/parflow-resources).\n",
    "\n",
    "You will have the following choices in selecting a template run script: \n",
    "1. **Select the ParFlow configuration you would like to start from**: We have templates for the ParFlow [CONUS1](https://hydroframe.org/parflow-conus1) and [CONUS2](https://hydroframe.org/parflow-conus2) domains. There are many differences between these domains which you can read about through the previous links. Generally speaking though the `CONUS2` model is the most up to date domain and is an advancement from the `CONUS1` domain. The `CONUS2` model has a deeper vertical extent, more vertical layers, updated topographic processing and updated subsurface geology from the `CONUS1` model\n",
    "2. **Determine whether you will run a box or solid file domain**: A solid file can be used to define an irregular domain boundary (e.g. a watershed boundary). If you run with a solid file only the cells within the solid file will be designated as active. Alternatively you can create a box domain that encompasses your desired watershed boundary. There is no inherently better choice between these two. Solid file domains allow you to impose irregular boundaries and limit the active computational domain but box domains can be simpler to work with. \n",
    "3. **Determine what type of simulation you would like to do**: There are two choices: \n",
    "    - **Spinup**: This template will run ParFlow with a constant recharge forcing at the upper boundary. This approach is used to initialize the groundwater configuration in a process called spinup (refer to the [spinup workflow notebook](https://hydroframesubsettools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_notebooks/conus1_subsetting_spinup.html)for a full example of this).  \n",
    "    - **Transient**: This template if for a transient ParFlow-CLM run. If you choose this option you will need to subset forcing files for your simulation (i.e. Precipitation, temperature, etc.) and you will also need a clm driver file (refer to the [transient workflow notebook](https://hydroframesubsettools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_notebooks/conus1_subsetting_transient.html)for a full example of this)\n"

For example a `P`=4, `Q`=2, `R`=1 topology would divided the domain across 8 processors splitting the x axes by 4 and the y axes by 2 but not splitting in the z direction *(NOTE: it its generally best practice not to split in the z direction)*\n",
